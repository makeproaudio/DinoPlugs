This Installer installs two versions of the Dino Park Editor UIs:

(1) VSTi Editors for use with your favourite DAW.
During installation, the VSTis will be copied to the following folder:
/Programs/VstPlugins/DinoPark

You may still need to specifically introduce these VSTis to your DAW and put specific MIDI routing provisions in place such that the editors can communicate with the DinoPark hardware. Please refer to our VSTi User Manual for further information:
https://www.makeproaudio.com/downloads/dinopark/manuals/VSTi_Manual_v1.0_MakeProAudio_Dino_Park.pdf

(2) Standalone Editors
A number of users expressed the wish to be able to run DinoPark Editor UIs independent of another DAW - so we are happy to release such standalone Editors (for Windows 32/64 and OSX) with this release. Basically, these editors include their own little VSTi host and can therefore be started independently whether or not there is another DAW installed. Please note that only one Standalone Editor can be opened at a time. Once you have set the MIDI Ports via File/Preferences the further UI and preset functionality is identical to the VSTIs.


Enjoy Dino Park!
